# **App Name**: GoodCode

## Core Features:

- File Upload: Drag-and-drop interface for uploading Python code files.
- Vulnerability Scanning: AI-powered vulnerability scanner tool that identifies potential security vulnerabilities in Python code. 
- Fix Suggestions: Suggests fixes for identified vulnerabilities, including code examples. This tool will automatically find potential improvements in the uploaded code, without being asked. The feature is inspired from Github Copilot Code Editor and Cursor Code Editor.
- Code Simplification: AI-powered code simplification that minimizes lines and memory usage while preserving logic and syntax of Python code.
- Reporting Dashboard: View scan history, remediation progress and code improvements. Storing all the code submission history, and code changes history like Github from where users can access the edited code and can manual fix it if necessary.
- Team Collaboration: Option to collaborate in teams to manage project-based scans. (Keep that Feature in Beta for now).

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Soft blue (#7BB7FF), evoking trust and security without being a cliche. This is suitable for use as the most visible foreground element over a dark background.
- Background color: Dark gray (#2A2D34), provides a professional look.
- Accent color: Soft violet (#B150FF), emphasizes interactive elements.
- Headline font: 'Space Grotesk' (sans-serif) for a computerized, techy feel, especially in titles and headings. Body font: 'Inter' (sans-serif) for the body.
- Code font: 'Source Code Pro' (monospace) for displaying code snippets.
- Use clear and simple icons representing security, code, and collaboration concepts.
- Clean and structured layout for easy navigation.
- Subtle animations to indicate loading, scanning, and code simplification processes. Try to have some UI responsive designs.
